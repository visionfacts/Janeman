Khushali, some relationships don’t need big words or perfect explanations — they are simply felt.
You came into my life so naturally that I don’t even remember when you became such an important part of me. Now it feels impossible to imagine my life without you. 
If we don’t talk, something inside me feels incomplete, like a small piece of my happiness is missing.

You are not just my best friend. You are the person I can be completely myself with — no filters, no fear, no pretending. With you, I don’t have to be strong all the time. I can laugh freely, cry honestly(abhi tak to kbhi esi dikat nhi ahi hai), and share the parts of me I hide from the world. And the most beautiful thing is… you understand me without me having to explain everything.

Maybe I get a little possessive sometimes, but that only comes from how deeply I value you. People come and go in life, but someone like you is rare. You are not replaceable. You are not temporary. You are a part of my heart.

No matter where life takes us, the place you hold in my life will always belong to you. Always. 🤍

If you want it even more intense or shorter but more powerful, tell me 💔✨

i am always there for you
